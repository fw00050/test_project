Most of us are now aware of the pressures placed on our wildlife by development in the modern world. Recently we have seen a proliferation of legislation, introduced by both the UK Government and the EU, designed to protect our biodiversity and safeguard our countryside. 
</p>

<p>
This part of the website will introduce some of the ways the BRC can support local societies, schools and individuals who want to begin recording or learn new skills to help them improve their recording. It will also provide you with some background information and highlight some aspects of Kent's communities and environments that we are involved in.
